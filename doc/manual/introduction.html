<h1>Introduction<h1>
Our modern societey uses one underlying defining technology: Computers. 
In many different shape or form they are intimately coupled into our daily lifes
and basically nothing would work without their use.

So it seems a bit strange how little the average person actually knowns about how
computers do the things that they are doing. This even is true for IT professional
who normally live and think in their specific layer of abstraction. 

What we encounter on a daily basis are specifically made user interfaces that
are tailored to the needs of our human minds. Who still knowns what is 
working underneath? What makes computers tick? And who actually knows what 
a Byte is?

<h1>Goal of this instruction manual</h1>

This manual to accompany the OS816 computer is aimed to provide you with
the most complete knowledge possible on how the OS816 itselfs works. It is 
structured as an interactive course using the OS816 itself as its sole 
object of its study. By narrowing down the focus so completely, every aspect
of it can be discussed in full depth, even down to the electrical signal level.

The knowledge gained will give you a firm understanding of computers in general.
Even the most powerful and sophisticated machines today are still working
in basically the same way, even if they have grown much, much more powerful and
complex by now in many decades of constant evolution.
